				<p>
					As a non-profit foundation, CharityLife is truly one of a kind. Usually, companies become commercially successful before giving back, but in our case, nothing would have happened without the starting belief that "it is more blessed to give than to receive".

					It is with that in mind that we started CharityLife in 2001 with the following simple idea: to massively boost non-profits' fundraising potential by giving them the tools to empower their supporters to fundraise on their behalf.

					It was only in 2004, on the momentum of CharityLife's core transactional engine, that our Founders created PayProp – essentially a commercialisation of the CharityLife payment platform for the property industry – under the banner of technology services group Humanstate.

					Today, we enjoy the service-based, infrastructural and financial support of PayProp – which has quickly grown to become a leading rental payment platform in multiple regions – and of Humanstate.

					That is also how we manage to keep it lean, by only taking a 5% admin fee, all of which is re-invested into building new tools to make giving better for everyone. We help people change the world through automation, the passion of a handful of devotees, and a little help from our friends.
